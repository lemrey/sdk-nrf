This sample can be found under |sample path| in the |NCS| folder structure.

In the limited sampling release of the |NCS|, you need to use the command line to program the nRF54H20 PDK.
See :ref:`gs_programming` for other building and programming scenarios and :ref:`gs_testing` for general information about testing and debugging in the |NCS|.

   .. caution::
      You should use west to program the nRF54H20 PDK during the limited sampling release.

      Using the ``nrfjprog -e`` command to program the nRF54H20 PDK will brick the device.
      Use the ``west flash --erase-storage`` command instead.

Complete the following steps to program the nRF54H20 PDK:

1. Open a terminal window in the |sample path| directory inside the |NCS| folder structure.
#. Build the application using the west command:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      |build command|

   If you want to configure your application, see :ref:`configure_application` for additional information.

   After running the ``west build`` command, the build files can be found in :file:`build/zephyr`.
   For more information about files generated as output of the build process, see :ref:`app_build_output_files`.
   For more information on the contents of the build directory, see :ref:`zephyr:build-directory-contents` in the Zephyr documentation.

#. Connect the PDK to your computer using a USB cable.
#. Power on the PDK.
#. Program the application to the kit using the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      west flash --erase

   This command clears the full flash memory before programming, which is the recommended approach.

   As an alternative, you can also clear only those flash memory pages that are to be overwritten with the new application.
   With this approach, the old data in other areas will be retained.

   To erase only the areas of flash memory that are required for programming the new application, use the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      west flash

   The ``west flash`` command automatically resets the kit and starts the application.

For more information on building and programming with the command line, see the Zephyr documentation on :ref:`zephyr:west-build-flash-debug`.
