This page outlines the available samples for the nRF54H20 that are tested for the initial limited sampling.
It includes the nRF Connect SDK samples and nRF Connect SDK application sections that showcase how to implement typical use cases with Nordic Semiconductor libraries and drivers.
Additionally, the page lists the available Zephyr samples that are compatible with the nRF54H20.
You can also find these in Zephyr’s Samples and Demos documentation.
